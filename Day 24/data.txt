And so I cry sometimes
When I'm lying in bed
Just to get it all out
What's in my head

And I am feeling a little peculiar
And so I wake in the morning
And I step outside
And I take a deep breath
and I get real high
And I scream at the top of my lungs

And I scream at the top of my lungs
    
What's going on?
And I say, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
I said hey, what's going on?
And i say, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA
i said hey,whats going on
